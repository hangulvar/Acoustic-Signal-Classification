# Acoustic-Signal-Classification
This project Aims to train a foundational CNN to classify acoustic signals generated/propagated in oceans and water bodies, to identify the type of vessel. This can work as a benchmark for other improvement efforts.

## Data
The data has been taken from DeepShip repository: (https://github.com/irfankamboh/DeepShip). It contains 47 hours and 04 minutes of real world underwater recordings and metadata of 265 different ships belong
to four classes. The recordings have natural background noise, marine mammal sounds as well as Anthropogenic sounds.

A more extensive dataset is available on google drive locations provided here: (https://github.com/irfankamboh/DeepShip/issues/1).
